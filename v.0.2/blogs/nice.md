# Do Something Nice

**Posted on October 19, 2024**

Yesterday was really amazing; it's so relaxing how there can be more life in the countryside than in the city. Talking about how the city can be filled with the constant noise and traffic. It is actually a good thing and time to disconnect from all city stress for our best mental health.

By the ways, this afternoon an old time friend of mine gave me a call and asked if I would be interested for a long drive to Hillborough. The journey itself was hella refreshing, with open roads surrounded by beautiful ***Canadian fall trees***. Their leaves had transformed into vibrant shades of red, orange, and gold.

Upon arriving in Hillborough, it was amazing to see beautiful buildings, farms, and residents in the area. We took our time and parked the car and took a moment to step out and absorb the surroundings and take some pictures.

The way the sunlight filtered through the branches, casting playful shadows on the ground, was mesmerizing. I spent a couple of minutes capturing photographs of the scenery.

Being in the countryside allowed me and my friend to reflect on my life and other good things to do. I felt a deep sense of peace and inspiration during my drive, and I encourage everyone to take a moment to appreciate the world around them and visit the countryside.

I was able to see the big lake separating ***Hillborough*** from ***Sackville***.

Before heading back to the city, we got ourselves some German bread at the bakery, feeling grateful for the time spent in nature.

*YOLO!*
