# Optimizing Interrupt Handlers for Retro Consoles

**Posted on May 2025**

This post explores writing efficient interrupt handlers in C for retro consoles like the Game Boy Advance. Key techniques include:

- **Minimizing Latency**: Reducing the time spent in interrupt service routines by prioritizing critical tasks.
- **Interrupt Prioritization**: Configuring hardware to handle high-priority interrupts first.
- **Resource Constraints**: Ensuring compatibility with limited CPU and memory resources.

For example, in the GBA, you might optimize a VBlank interrupt handler to update the display buffer efficiently:

```c
void vblank_handler() {
    // Critical display update code
    REG_DISPCNT = update_buffer();
}
```

These strategies are crucial for smooth performance in retro gaming systems.
