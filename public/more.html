        Hello, my name is <strong><em></em></strong> I am passionate about computers and programming. My journey began when I developed a love for video games at the age of 11. Video games have always made me happy. A couple of years later, when I turned 13, my uncle gifted me a PlayStation 2 for my birthday. It was an incredible console, and I fell in love with it. However, I encountered a challenge: purchasing video games was difficult at that age. This led me to research how to get games on my PlayStation 2 without using physical discs.

        I was amazed by the information I found and learned a lot during this process. The PlayStation 2 is essentially a computer in its own right. I got hands-on experience by installing homebrew software, enabling me to load games from a USB drive as ISO images. This learning curve was fascinating, and I gained knowledge about ISO images, formatting USB drives to FAT32, directories, and flashing ISO images onto empty discs. This experience significantly kindled my interest in computers.

        In grade 11, I was introduced to BASIC in my science class. It was an enjoyable class, and I appreciated every part of it. As I progressed, I learned about logic and truth tables, which made things clearer. After high school, I picked up C as my first programming language. Learning C was a fun and great experience that helped me build a strong foundation in programming.
