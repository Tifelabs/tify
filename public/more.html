                I'm just a dude that loves all things about computers and programming. My journey began when I developed love for video games at the age of 11. Video games have always made me happy. A couple of years later, when I turned 13, my uncle gifted me a PlayStation 2 for my birthday. It was an incredible console, and I fell in love with it, the console looks so sick. However, I encountered a challenge: purchasing video games was difficult at that age. This led me to research how to get games on my PlayStation 2 without using physical discs.

                I was amazed by the information I found and learned a lot during this process. The PlayStation 2 is essentially a computer in its own right. I got hands-on experience by installing homebrew software, enabling me to load games from a USB drive as ISO images, transferring iso files from pc to USB using USBUtil. It's so interesting i spent alots of hours on <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/"><strong>PSX-PLACE</strong></a>. This learning curve was fascinating, and I gained knowledge about ISO images, formatting USB drives to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32">FAT32</a>, directories, and flashing ISO images onto empty discs. This experience significantly kindled my interest in computers.

                In grade 11, I was introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> in my science class. It was an enjoyable class, and I appreciated every part of it. As I progressed, I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">Logic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth tables</a>, which made things clearer. After high school, I picked up C as my first programming language. Learning C was a fun and great experience that helped me build a strong foundation in programming.

                Then, I started messing around with different technologies, trying to learn new things every day. I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi kit, and I tried to build projects and have fun. It was really worth it. Moreover, I'm a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, and I've been using it for close to 2 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> has been my favorite distro. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> made me learn a lot by breaking things and trying to fix them, setting up config files, and getting familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Terminal</a> and other commands.

                Perhaps, I used some flavors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux"><strong>Kali</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_Security_OS"><strong>Parrot</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)"><strong>Fedora</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux"><strong>Gentoo</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop!_OS"><strong>Pop!_OS</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu"><strong>Ubuntu</strong></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux"><strong>Arch</strong></a>. After gallivanting around, I chose to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian"><strong>Debian</strong></a> as my permanent OS.
